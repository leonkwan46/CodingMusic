# CodingMusic

⚡ Whilst in my Bachelor's final year, I came across Alogorithm Music with Iannis Xenakis's music composition and decided to dive into this rabbit hole

⚡ I discover that I can actually execute music with codes (mind-blown🤯)

⚡ There are many software built specifically for this genre - CodingMusic, but I decided to go with Sonic Pi (https://sonic-pi.net/)

⚡ My music is written in Ruby, clean and easy to understand, almost feel like coding in English
