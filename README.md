# CodingMusic

Whilst in my Bachelor's final year, I came across Alogorithm Music with Iannis Xenakis's music composition and decided to dive into this rabbit hole. 

I discover that I can actually execute music with codes. (mind-blownðŸ¤¯)

There are many software built specifically for this genre - CodingMusic, but I decided to go with Sonic Pi. (Check out: https://sonic-pi.net/)

My music is written in Ruby, clean and easy to understand, almost feel like coding in English
